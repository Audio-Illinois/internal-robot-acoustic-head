# Quiet Rotating Platform

This turntable locks onto the 3D printed head and rotates it quietly, enabling audio experiments with _repeatable_ source motion.

## âš™ 1. Sourcing the parts

#### ðŸ–¨ 3D Print Files

All printable components are provided as `.stl` files in the [`solids/`](./solids) directory:

| Links | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Base Platform](./solids/base.stl) <br/> + [Motor Case](./solids/motorcase.stl) | The main stationary part of the turntable that encases the motor and homing induction sensor |
| [Grabber](./solids/grabber.stl) <br/> + [Plate](./solids/plate.stl) | The payload portion of the turntable that friction-fits with a dummy head and is rotated by the motor |

#### ðŸ§¾ PCB Fabrication Files

All files required for manufacturing the PCB can be found in [`gerber.zip`](./gerber.zip). This can be uploaded to a PCB manufacturer such as [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) and fabricated with low turnaround time and cost. Tutorials on using PCBWay are available on YouTube.

## ðŸ’¾ 3. Software

#### 1. Setup host PC

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Audio-Illinois/robot-acoustic-head.git
cd robot-acoustic-head/robot-mount
```
Onto a PC with either ALSA (Linux) or ASIO (Windows) audio drivers. Preferably, have Python 3.8.10 installed.

Install the necessary libraries
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Flash Arduino

Install [`arduino-cli`](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cli/installation/) for convenient Arduino flashing. Then, run:
```bash
cd scripts
python3 ./upload.py -P $PORT
```
> ðŸ’¡ On an Ubuntu machine, you likely should set `PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0`. On Windows, try `PORT=COM4`.

Errors are expected when first calling this script - just follow the suggestions provided.

This is optional and you can instead use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/), which will also make identifying the relevant serial port easier.

In either case, ensure that the [TMC2208Stepper](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/tmc2208stepper/) library is installed via Package Manager.

#### 3. Control the robot through console commands

Run 
```bash
python3 ./teleop.py $PORT
```

Example commands are `home`, which can be used to check that the homing induction sensor is wired properly, and `move <degrees>`/`move <degrees> <revs/s>` which is used to check that the motor calibration is correct. 

> ðŸ’¡ It is advised to clamp the robot turntable onto a desk or other heavy platform.
