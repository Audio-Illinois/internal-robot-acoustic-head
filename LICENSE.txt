Disclaimer

It has been observed that under certain conditions, particularly when the movement of the
robot turntable is restricted (e.g., by entangled cables) for several hours, the stepper
motor may overheat. This overheating can potentially lead to the softening or melting of
3D-printed hardware components, and in severe cases, may result in damage to the device
or connected equipment.

Users are advised to:

* Ensure that cables and other potential obstructions do not impede the free movement of the
    robot turntable.
* Monitor the temperature of the motor and surrounding hardware components during operation.
* Implement appropriate safety measures to prevent damage in the event of overheating.
* Exercise caution when operating the device for extended periods or under heavy load.

The authors and copyright holders disclaim any and all liability for damage, injury, or
loss resulting from the overheating of the device or any failure to follow the
recommended precautions. Users assume all responsibility for the safe assembly and operation
of this device.
